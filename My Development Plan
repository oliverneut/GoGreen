I want to develop my ability to become a leader for future and larger projects by contributing with my skills and pushing my limits to the maximum. 

The communication between the teammates are also an essential part for the leadership within a project and therefore, I also have the ambition to 
improve my communication skills.

Additionally, I want to develop my current programming skills with Java GUI by applying it to various fields and projects. 

Finally, I want to improve my problem solving skills by simplify or finding new or alternative solutions to existing ones.
