# Rauf's Personal Development Plan


## My plan: become better at retaining oversight in complex projects by effectively communicating (receiving and sending) ideas and tasks with other team members and making sure everyone is on the same page. 



This is important to me because I believe synergy is the most important factor in getting complex work done, and I believe communication is key to this.

This goal is achieved when we can effectively break down and tackle problem as a team; mid-project or nearing the end.



I try to achieve this by talking openly, asking people for their ideas and having everyone say something they would like to add.


I hope to be able to implement communication systems, or agreements on particular communication, so that people will be constantly updated about my work and I know their work.

I think Git will be able to help us in this.

After the bachelor I know that as a programmer, you need to work with other people. So my main goal is to train myself to work efficiently with people who I don’t know. 
Each of these people with other abilities will learn me a lot.
